				<p>This is a collection of work that I completed for my Basic Skills in the Digital Arts class at Illinois State University. I am by no means a visual artist, but for some of these assignments I had fun, and the class overall was helpful with getting a better grasp on the creative process which is pretty well universal through all artistic expression. It's important to work consistently and often, even if what you make isn't always good. If you create enough over time, odds are at least something will be worth the effort.</p>

					<a href="images/uncomfortable.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="This was the first piece we did in our Digital Art class. The premise was to utilise a medium we aren't comfortable with and create something with it. So, as someone who is terrible with creating visual art, I chose to try and create something in Microsoft Paint. As expected, it was terrible, but some of my classmates had much more success in their chosen uncomfortable medium and found some new things they enjoyed!"><img src="thumbnails/uncomfortable_tn.jpg"></a>

					<a href="images/headerv03.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="At the top of the page, you might have noticed that there's a similar header. This assignment involved choosing a couple images and, using photoshop, put together a series of 20 headers we could eventually use for our portfolio project. I ended up creating a little 8-bit version of myself in Paint for this project. While it didn't might the final cut for the header, I decided to include it in this bottom section because I thought it was cute."><img src="thumbnails/headerv03_tn.jpg"></a>
					<a href="images/Piplup_Kilobyte.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="This was a rather odd assignment where we were told to create a data visualization of the relation between a kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte. So, I decided to use Pokemon like the nerd I am and wrote a block of text to connect the dots. I liked this project because I could write and didn't have to use my own visual art!"><img src="thumbnails/Piplup_Kilobyte_tn.jpg"></a>
					<a href="images/doorknob.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="I actually really enjoyed this assignment. This one involved creating some kind of (removable!!!) graffiti and take a picture of it wherever we placed it. I chose to draw the talking doorknob from Alice in Wonderland and put it on the doorknob to my room. He's still there over a month later! I think I'll keep him."><img src="thumbnails/doorknob_tn.jpg"></a>
					<a href="images/remix.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="This was something I actually did for an assignment when I was back at Heartland. When this assignment came up in class a couple of us in the class asked if we could use something we'd remixed previously, and the professor encouraged it because repurposing and exploring previous things we created was something he encouraged.
					<br> The reason I chose Saturn Devouring His Son was because, when I took a trip to Spain back in high school, I actually saw this painting in person. For some reason, it really disturbed me in a way I can't verbally express. So, what better subject to work with than a piece that disturbed me?
					<br> My poor cat was very unamused with this idea, though. I could only get one picture before he scampered off. Admittedly, Saturn didn't give me the best position to hold a cat."><img src="thumbnails/remix_tn.jpg"></a>
					<a href="images/bloodycrying.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="This project involved fabricating three different artists, talking about their story, and creating a piece of art in their style. This artist is Evan Bier who goes by the moniker Echo. He's a 17 year old kid in Seattle, Washington and likes to create his version of disturbing/creepy emojis. Like me, he's not a very good artist, but he has fun with what he's doing!"><img src="thumbnails/bloodycrying_tn.jpg"></a>
					<a href="images/pptss.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="The last project we did in this class before working on this portfolio was a presentation on someone/something within the digital world that is important to us. I chose to present on the video game Bastion and its creator, the indie company Supergiant Games. Their creativity and work ethic are something I really look up to, and to have created such a fun game with just seven people is mind-blowing to me. If you want to listen to the two songs shown on this screen capture, they are Build That Wall and Mother, I'm Here from the Bastion soundtrack. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to set up a link within this lightbox, as the lightbox is one big link in itself."><img src="thumbnails/pptss_tn.jpg"></a>
