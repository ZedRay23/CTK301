				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>My first draft of this, I pretty much wrote my whole life story. It was a lot. So, I'm going to try and make this much more concise. My dream is to create worlds, whether they be within a gaming space or written, that people can find peace and solace in like how I used games and books in my childhood and even today. I've had a long path to get to where I am today, but for the first time in a long time I feel like I know where I'm going and I'm very happy about that. I'm looking forward to what the future holds and what more I can learn from my time at Illinois State University in the Game Design program.</p>

				<p>PS: If you understand the footer, I appreciate you. If you don't, that's okay too! It's a niche reference, but fitting in this context I believe.</p>
