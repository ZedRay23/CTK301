				<h3>The Pressure Plate Puzzle - Games</h3>
				<p>One assignment given to the class during my Game Design 2 class was to create a level using the FPS Microgame preset on Unity. I chose to create a puzzle based on pressure plates that I programmed, so standing on a yellow or green square on the ground would cause something to happen and the square to go down.</p>

				<h3>Night Crawl - Games</h3>
				<p>As part of the Game Development Club at Illinois State University for spring semester 2022, we created a top-down rogue-like nightmare themed game, and I was part of the level design team for the game, and it was our job to utilize the assets given to us by the art team to put together levels for the player to run around in. I also had the honor of being the one to suggest the name that ended up being chosen for the game, Night Crawl.</p>

				<h3>The Circus Dropper - Games</h3>
				<p>This project is still a work in progress (hopefully I will have it done by the 6th, which is when it's due), but the gist of it is that it's a pachinko-style game based off of one we made in my Game Development class. Our final assignment of the semester is to take one of the games we've made through the semester and expand on it, so I chose the pachinko game.</p>
