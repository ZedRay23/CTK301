In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition. ". . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?" "Mum,.no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure," said Bill patiently. "And your hair's getting silly, dear," said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly." I wish you'd let me give it a trim. . . ." "I like it," said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. "You're so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's...." Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup. </p>
